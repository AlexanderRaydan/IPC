The price1 represents a float and when you show the value 17.96 as a float, 
the internal value in the variable is 17.959999. Then the program multiplies 
price1 by 100, giving a result of 1795.9999 and finally, cast as an int, and 
when we cast from double to int, the value is rounded down, giving a final 
result 1795.

The three examples work as intended because in this example all divisions have
at least a double and are represented with the same format “%.2lf”.

The variable “result” is initialized as an int with the value 7245 and then divided by 100, 
the result of 2 integer numbers is another integer with the integer part of the result of the division.

1. $0.00
2. $72
3. $0.00
4. $72

The sample 1 and 3 do not work because the variable result and money are integers 
and if you print an integer number as a large float number, you will get 0.00 as a result.
